# The-Leaf-Coders

## Problem Statement 
There has always been a lack of security in second hand ticket sales, as the buyer has to trust the words of the owner
that the tickets they are selling are legitimate and they will not sell the same ticket to multiple people. There have
been many cases when people found out that they were sold duplicate tickets or the same ticket was sold to someone else 
also.

## Problem Solution
We take the real ticket and mint it as NFT and deploy it on Polygon Blockchain using the smart contract that we built and
also we have stored the data using the IPFS and pinata storage. We have integrated metamask for decentralized transactions.
